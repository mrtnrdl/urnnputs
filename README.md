## urnnputs
Inputs for [urnn](https://github.com/nixers-projects/urnn).

urnn only needs data about the image and color pair, and one that is extracted there is no need to commit large images like wallpapers to its repo. But it can be nice to have a visual reference to those. The plan is eventually for this to have a github pages generated to easily browse them.

### Contributing
If you have a wallpaper-xresources pair to request addition to these inputs, submit a pull request to the staging repo containing:
* a .resources file (xresources format)
* a .png file
* a .txt file, containing an origin/credit text snippet(optional)

All three of these files must be the same name in your pull request, and a screenshot showing them together would be appreciated but is not necessary.
